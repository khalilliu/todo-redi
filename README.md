The scaffold for [redi](https://redi.wendell.fun). Check out the [TodoMVC demo](https://github.com/wendellhu95/redi-todomvc) which uses redi-starter.

## Features

- Out-of-box dev toolchain, with *redi* inside. React, TypeScript, webpack, ESLint, Jest and Prettier.
- Build from differently entries and ship different bundles on different devices. For example, you won't ship `PcPlatformService` to mobile devices and vice versa.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wendellhu95/redi-starter.git
``` 

If you do not want to have git history you can use degit:
